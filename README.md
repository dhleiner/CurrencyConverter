# Currency Converter
This program was created for my own learning purposes.
This program gets its name from the fact that it does conversions between various world currencies.
It also can calculate the factors of an number, determine whether a number is prime, yield the prime factorization
of a number, or generate a Fibonacci series of length n.

## Installation
Clone this repository to the appropriate editor. I used Visual Studio Code.

## Usage
Run the program and enter a number into the input box. It can calculate the factors of an number, determine whether a number is prime, yield the prime factorization
of a number, or generate a Fibonacci series of length n, as well as converting currencies based on exchange values in the year 2020.
